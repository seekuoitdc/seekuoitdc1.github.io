<p><img src="images/software-electronics-heroes.gif" alt="famous electrical engineers">
We give you access to student run library of electronics prototyping parts, boards, tools and instruments. All parts together at a desk will look like a professional <a href="http://casperelectronics.com/images/TheWorkbench.jpg)">electronics workbench</a> used by makers and busy engineers. We hold meetings every week:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Tuesdays</strong>, 11:30 a.m. - 1:30 p.m. at ACE 4020</li>
<li>
<strong>Wednesdays</strong>, 11:30 a.m. - 1:30 p.m. at ACE 4020</li>
<li>
<strong>Wednesdays</strong>, 2:10 p.m - 6:10 p.m. at SA Clubs' Space (near security desk in Gordon Wiley Bldg.)</li>
</ul>

<p>We give you electronics prototyping parts, tools, and collaborate with partners who do the same. See what the EE maker and prototyping library at <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16WL_NKTxxhU5NL4flWcO3onCrfHl0LCvcAJNRAw46vY/edit?usp=sharing">McNaughton Center</a> and at <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uoit.net/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqilyhblBuNKdGxlYXhlMTB0RVVzbFBOdmRoeHZHblE&amp;usp=sharing">SEEK</a> have. They are used <strong>for free</strong> during club meetings. The tools and parts consist of, just to mention a few: high end oscilloscopes, solder stations, embedded systems kits, FPGA boards, analog actives and passives, arduino and raspberry pi kits, and more. Make sure you checkout parts; use them to make real world products right away by following <a href="http://nextproject.ca/pages.php?p=students">our tutorials</a>.</p>

<p>Any part you need but SEEK or McNaughton Center does not carry, send SEEK's exec. <em><a href="mailto:dhimiter.qendri@uoit.net">dhimiter.qendri@uoit.net</a></em> a 4 sentence e-mail with "what is it's name and part number, where can it be bought, how much is it, why needed". We will buy those parts and lend them to you as soon as possible at club meetings.</p>

<p>Our team is always there for you. Please contact SEEK's Exec. <em><a href="mailto:SagarMonkeyBoy@gmail.com">SagarMonkeyBoy@gmail.com</a></em> with your questions.</p>
