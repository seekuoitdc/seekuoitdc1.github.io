<p>We give you access to student run open hardware library similar to EE Work bench. It has high end oscilloscopes, solder stations, software tools, and many <a href="http://casperelectronics.com/images/TheWorkbench.jpg)">EE prototyping</a> as [current inventory of parts], tools &amp; boards][#inventory]. Over September more equipment will be added as shown in future inventory.</p>

<p>We share office with McNaughton Center, at ACE 4020. We hold meetings every week: <strong>Tuesdays, 11:30 a.m. - 1:30 p.m.</strong> and <strong>Wednesdays, 11:30 a.m. - 1:30 p.m., 2:10 p.m - 6:10 p.m.</strong> As beginner you will learn to build electronics and software. Use <a href="http://nextproject.ca/pages.php?p=students">past projects</a> as inspiration to get started right now.</p>

<p>We provide you with all parts you need. Any part SEEK doesn't carry, McNaughton Center's current inventory of parts library should carry. In case they do not, you can order parts at SEEK or McNaughton Center by sending a "what is it's name and part number, where can it be bought, how much is it, why needed" 4 sentence e-mail to SEEK's exec. <em><a href="mailto:dhimiter.qendri@uoit.net">dhimiter.qendri@uoit.net</a></em></p>

<p>We mentor you to go from beginner to pro. Everything is free to use. You have freedom as pro or beginner to make and hack electronics and software. This way you make and prototype real world products and device of electrical, software engineering.</p>

<p>Our team is always there for you. Please contact SEEK's Exec. <em><a href="mailto:SagarMonkeyBoy@gmail.com">SagarMonkeyBoy@gmail.com</a></em> with your questions.</p>

<p>People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware â€” Alan Kay</p>
