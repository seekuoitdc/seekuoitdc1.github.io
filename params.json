All parts together at a desk will look like a professional [electronics hacker/maker workbench][bench]. We hold meetings every week: **Tuesdays**, 11:30 a.m. - 1:30 p.m. at ACE4020 and **Wednesdays**, 11:30 a.m. - 1:30 p.m. at ACE2040, 2:10 p.m - 6:10 p.m. at SA Clubs' Space (near security desk in Gordon Wiley Bldg.)\r\n\r\n[bench]: http://casperelectronics.com/images/TheWorkbench.jpg)\r\n\r\nAll our and our partners' prototyping library at [McNaughton Center][mcnaughton] and at [SEEK] are used **for free** during club meetings.The tools and parts consist of, just to mention a few: high end oscilloscopes, solder stations, FPGA boards, analog actives and passives, arduino and raspberry pi kits, and more. Make sure you checkout parts; use them to make real world products right away by following [our tutorials][tut].\r\n\r\n[mcnaughton]: #\r\n[seek]: https://docs.google.com/a/uoit.net/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqilyhblBuNKdGxlYXhlMTB0RVVzbFBOdmRoeHZHblE&usp=sharing#gid=0\r\n[tut]: http://nextproject.ca/pages.php?p=students\r\n\r\nAny part you need but [SEEK][seek] or [McNaughton Center][mcnaughton] does not carry, send SEEK's exec. *dhimiter.qendri@uoit.net* a 4 sentence e-mail with \"what is it's name and part number, where can it be bought, how much is it, why needed\". We will buy those parts and lend them to you as soon as possible at club meetings.\r\n\r\nOur team is always there for you. Please contact SEEK's Exec. *SagarMonkeyBoy@gmail.com* with your questions.\r\n\r\nPeople who are really serious about software should make their own hardware â€” Alan Kay","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
